# Warrior's Spirit
At {@level}, you have reached the pinnacle of gritty determination.
Your fighting spirit can delay the very clutches of death.
When you start dying, you can choose to retain your consciousness (no action required).
When you do so, you are able to act as normal&mdash;even as you draw your last breath.
Taking damage causes death saving throw failures as normal, and three death saving throw failures can still kill you.

While you are dying, you can choose to fall unconscious at any time on your turn (no action required).
