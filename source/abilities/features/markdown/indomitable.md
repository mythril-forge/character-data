# Indomitable
By {@level}, you have learned to focus through even the harshest of punishment.
If you fail a saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead.
Likewise, if an attack hits you, you can choose to avoid the attack, causing it to miss instead.

You can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.
Starting at {@level}, you can use this feature twice between rests.
