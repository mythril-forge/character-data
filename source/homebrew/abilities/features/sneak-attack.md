# Sneak Attack
Beginning at `{( level )}`, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction.
Once per turn, when you have advantage on the attack roll for an attack using dexterity and hit, you can deal an amount of extra damage that increases when you gain `{( class )}` levels, as shown in the *Sneak Attack* column of the *"`{( class )}`"* table.
If you attack with a weapon that has the finesse property, then you don't need to use dexterity to gain this benefit.
