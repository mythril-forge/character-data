# Called Shots
Once you reach `{( level )}`, you learn to spot and exploit weaknesses in an opponent's form&mdash;hitting them where it hurts most.
When you make an attack, you can declare a number between 1 and your `{( class )}` level to take as a penalty to hit.
If your attack hits, it deals extra damage equal to the declared penalty.

You can only decide to use this feature before you make your attack roll.
