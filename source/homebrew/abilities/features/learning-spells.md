# Learning Spells
You have familiarity with an array of spells.
You may not be able to produce all of these spells at a moment's notice, but given some time to prepare, you can cast any of them.

## Spells Known
You know one spell of your choice from the `{( class )}` spell list when you first obtain this spellcasting feature.

> ## Variant: Starting with More Spells
> Your DM might let you know more spells when you start your character if you start at a higher level than one.
> A reasonable number of spells for you to know would be the number that you are able to prepare.

## Learning a New Spell
As a `{( class )}`, you have the capacity to learn new spells from the [`{( class )}` spell list].

Learning a new `{( class )}` spell involves `{( learning-spells )}`.
The process takes at least 3 hours and consumes 6 component kits.
For each level of the spell, it takes 3 additional hours and consumes 6 more component kits.
Once you have spent these resources and have finished a long rest, you know the spell and can prepare it as normal.

You can only learn one spell per long rest.
If you spend the resources necessary to learn more than one spell, then you must choose one to finish learning at the end of your next long rest.
You can finish learning the other spells with more resting.

## Limit of Spells Known
The maximum number of `{( class )}` spells that you may know is shown in the spells known column of the *"`{( class )}`"* table for each level.
You may know fewer, but the number of `{( class )}` spells that you know cannot surpass this number.

## Forgetting a Spell
Whenever you finish a long rest, you have the option to forget one spell of your choice.
You can also choose to forget a spell whenever you learn a new one, effectively replacing it.
