# Dueling
If you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack while you are wielding no more than one melee weapon, you can roll all of the attack's damage dice one additional time plus any damage modifiers.
This roll counts for determining the extra damage for your critical hit.
The weapon cannot have the heavy or two-handed property for you to gain this benefit.
