# Arcane Recovery
You have learned how to regain some of your magical energy by pulling magic out of certain objects that are familiar to you, such as your spellbook, your spellcasting focus, and your spell components.
This capacity is represented by arcana points, which extend to you a degree of flexibility in your magic.

## Arcana Points
You have a number of arcana points, and you gain more as you reach higher `{( class )}` levels, as shown in the *"Arcana Points"* column of the *"`{( class )}`"* table.
However, you can never have more than the amount shown on the table for your level.
You regain all spent arcana points when you finish a long rest.

An arcana point is a type of spell point.
You can expend arcana points for any feature that uses spell points.

## Creating Spell Slots
You can transform unexpended spell points into one or more spell slots at the end of a short rest.
The *"Conversion Rates"* table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level.
You can use this feature to create spell slots no higher in level than 5th.
