# Destroy Undead
If an undead fails its saving throw against your *Turn Undead* feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold.
The threshold increases when you gain levels as a {@class}, as shown in the *"Destroy Undead"* column of the {@class} table.
