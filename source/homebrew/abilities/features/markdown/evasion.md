# Evasion
Beginning at {@level}, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an ice storm spell.
When you fail a Dexterity saving throw, you can use a reaction to flip a coin.
On a heads, you instead succeed on the saving throw.

In addition, when you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw.
