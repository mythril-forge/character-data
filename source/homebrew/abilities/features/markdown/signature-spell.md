# Signature Spell
When you reach {@level}, you gain such mastery over powerful spells that you can establish one as your signature spell.
To define your signature spell, you must undergo a grueling process of extreme research, concluded by finishing a long rest.
For each level of the spell you wish to yoke, the research process takes 30 hours and consumes 10 component kits.
You can undergo this process again to change your signature spell.

You have three magic charges for use with your chosen spell.
When you cast your signature spell, you can expend a magic charge.
If you do so, it counts as a cantrip for this casting, and you don't have to expend a spell slot.
You regain all spent magic charges when you finish a short or long rest.

You can only have one signature spell at a time, and it must be a {@class} spell of 3rd level or lower.
