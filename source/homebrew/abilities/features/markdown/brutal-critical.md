# Brutal Critical
Beginning at {@level} level, you deal massive damage when your weapon strikes true.
Whenever you score a critical hit with an attack that uses strength, you can roll all of the attack's damage dice one additional time plus any damage modifiers.
This roll counts for determining the extra damage for your critical hit.

This increases to two additional rolls at {@level} and three additional rolls at {@level}.
