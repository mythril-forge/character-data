# Deciphering Spells
You might find spells written in books and on scrolls during your adventures.
If you find a written {@class} spell, then you can study it and learn at an accelerated rate.

To learn about a written spell, you must decode the unique system of notation used by the spellcaster who wrote it.
Then, you can practice and reproduce the underlying form of the spell to understand it better.

The process takes at least half an hour and consumes one component kit.
For each level of the spell, it takes 30 additional minutes and consumes another component kit.
Once you spend these resources and finish a long rest, you know the spell and can prepare it.

Even when using this method to learn a spell, you are limited to learning one spell per long rest.
