# Turn Undead
At {@level}, you have gained the ability to use your *Channel Divinity* to fend off menacing undead.
You can take an action to present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead.
Each undead within 30 feet of you that can see or hear you must make a wisdom saving throw.
If a creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 5 minutes or until it faces a malevolent interaction (DM's discretion).

While turned in this way, a creature must spend its movement trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you.
It also can't take any bonus actions or reactions.
For its action, it can use only the dash or dodge action, or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving.
