## Sneak Attack
Beginning at {@level}, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction.
Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll.
The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.

The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the {@class} table.
