# Soul-Bonding
You've long held that you could fine-tune the generic magic that bonds a mage with their familiar, improving the mystic connection.
Having unraveled the technique for doing so, you gain more advantages from your familiar than most mages.
If you have a familiar from the *Find Familiar* spell or another source, you and your familiar both gain the following benefits when you are within 120 feet of one another:
- Your familiar has three more hit dice than normal.
	Its hit point maximum increases accordingly.
- You have access to all of your familiar's senses, virtually seeing from two perspectives at once.
	Your familiar also has access to all of your senses.
- Each time you take damage, you can choose to take half of the damage by transferring some of it to your familiar, who then also takes half of the damage.
	Likewise, each time your familiar takes damage, it can choose to take half of the damage by transferring half to you.
