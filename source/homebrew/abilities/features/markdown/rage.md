# Rage
In battle, you fight with primal ferocity.
You can enter a rage by taking a bonus action.

While raging, you gain the following effects:
- You have advantage on strength ability checks.
- When you hit with an attack using strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases when you gain levels as a {@class}, as shown in the *"Rage Damage"* column of the {@class} table.
- You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
- If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them while raging.
- Raging doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell&mdash;such as heat metal&mdash;that you've already cast.
- You have disadvantage on constitution saving throws that you make to maintain your concentration on spells.

Raging confers none of these effects while you are wearing heavy armor.

Once you have raged the number of times shown for your {@class} level in the *"Rages"* column of the {@class} table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.
