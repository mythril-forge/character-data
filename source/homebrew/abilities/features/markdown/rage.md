# Rage
Starting at {@level}, you fight with primal ferocity in battle.
On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.

While raging, you gain the following benefits:
- You have advantage on Strength Ability Checks.
- When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to its damage that increases as you gain levels as a {@class}, as shown in the "Rage Damage" column of the {@class} table.
- You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
- If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them while raging.
- Raging doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell&mdash;such as heat metal&mdash;that you've already cast.
- If you take damage while concentrating, the DC of concentration save becomes 21 or the damage you take, whichever number is higher.

Raging confers none of these benefits while wearing heavy armor.

Once you have raged the number of times shown for your {@class} level in the "Rages" column of the {@class} table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.
