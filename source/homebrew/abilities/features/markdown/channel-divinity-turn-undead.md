# Channel Divinity: Turn Undead
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to fend off and destroy undead abominations.
As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead.
Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom Saving Throw against your Spell Save DC.
If the creature fails its Saving Throw, it is frightened by you for 5 minutes or until it faces any malevolent interactions.

While frightened in this way, a creature must spend its movement trying to move as far away from you as it can.
It can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you, and it can't take any bonus actions or reactions.
When it takes an action, it can only use the dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving.
