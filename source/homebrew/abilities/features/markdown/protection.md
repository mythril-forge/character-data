# Protection
When a creature you can see attacks you or a target that is within 5 feet of you, you can take a reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, as well as any following attack rolls made by the trangressor against the one under your charge.
This benefit ends at the beginning of your next turn.
It ends early if your charge is no longer within 5 feet of you.
You must be wielding a shield to utilize this option.
