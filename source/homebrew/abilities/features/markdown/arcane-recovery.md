# Arcane Recovery
You have learned to pull power from the weave around you, restoring your magical energy.

You have 1 arcana point, and you gain additional arcana points every time you level up, as shown on the {@class} table.
You regain all spent arcana points when you finish a long rest.

## Universal Energy
An arcana point is a type of spell point.
You can use your arcana points on any feature that requires spell points.

## Converting Spell Points
You can transform unexpended spell points into spell slots at the end of a short or long rest.
For each spell slot that you want to make, spend a number of spell points equal to its spell point conversion rate, as shown in the spell points table below.
You can use this feature to create spell slots no higher in level than 5th.

Superfluous spell slots and spell points vanish at the end of a short rest.
