# Spell Slots and Casting Spells
The {@class} table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells at each level.
To cast a spell, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher.
However, you can cast a cantrip (a 0th level spell) at its lowest level without expending a spell slot.
You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest, and lose all excess spell slots when you finish a short rest.

You can only cast a spell that you have prepared to cast.
