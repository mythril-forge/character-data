# Spell Slots and Casting Spells
The *"{@class}"* table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells at each level.
To cast a spell that you have prepared, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher.
However, you can cast a cantrip (a 0th level spell) at its lowest level without expending a spell slot.
You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
While there are ways to recover spell slots outside of resting&mdash;such as drinking mana potions&mdash;you cannot have more spell slots of a given level than what is listed in the *"{@class}"* table.
