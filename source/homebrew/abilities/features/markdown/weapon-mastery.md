# Weapon Mastery
By {@level}, you have honed your weaponcraft to near perfection through hard work and dedication.
When you make a Weapon Attack with a weapon that you have proficiency with and roll a 10 or lower on your core die (usually 1d20), you can take a reaction to add 1d10 to the total of your Attack Roll.
This has the potential to change an attack that missed into an attack that hit.
