# Channel Divinity
At {@level}, you gain the ability to channel divine energy into a mote of power.
You will be granted features which require such power as you advance in {@class} levels, as shown in the {@class} table.

Once you use a *Channel Divinity* effect or feature, you must then finish a short or long rest to use another.
Beginning at {@level}, you can use your *Channel Divinity* to power effects twice between rests.
By {@level}, you can use it three times between rests.
