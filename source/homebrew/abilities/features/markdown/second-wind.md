# Second Wind
Beginning at {@level}, you have a limited well of stamina that you can draw upon to protect yourself from harm.
You can take a bonus action to regain a number of hit points that increases when you gain {@class} levels, as shown in the *"Second Wind"* column of the *"{@class}"* table.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.
Starting at {@level}, you can use it twice before resting.
