# Second Wind
Beginning at {@level}, you have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to a number of d4's equal to your Fighter Level.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.
Starting at {@level}, you can use it twice before resting.
