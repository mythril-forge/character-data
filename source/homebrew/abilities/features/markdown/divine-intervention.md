# Divine Intervention
Beginning at {@level}, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.

Imploring your deity's aid requires you to take an action.
Describe the assistance you seek, and make a special divinity check using a one hundred twenty-sided die.
Add your wisdom ability score and {@class} level when making this check.
If the result is greater than one hundred twenty, your deity intervenes.
The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any {@class} spell would be appropriate.

You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.
If your deity intervenes, you must also wait one full month before you can use this feature again.

By {@level}, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.
- **Divinity Check** = 1d120 + your cleric level + your wisdom ability score
