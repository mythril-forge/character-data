# Divine Intervention
Beginning at {@level}, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.

Imploring your deity's aid requires you to use your action.
Describe the assistance you seek, and roll 1d120 + your Wisdom Ability Score + your {@class} level.
If the result is higher than 120, your deity intervenes.
The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any {@class} spell would be appropriate.

You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.
If your deity intervenes, you must also wait one full month before you can use this feature again.

By {@level}, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.
