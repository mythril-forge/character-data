# Spellbook
At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level {@class} spells of your choice.
Your spellbook is the repository of the {@class} spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.

## Copying a Spell into the Book
When you find a {@class} spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.
Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the {@class} who wrote it.
You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.

For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp.
The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it.
Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.

A {@class} spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied.
When you copy a spell from a spell scroll, you must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level.
If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied.
Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.

## Replacing the Book
You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book&mdash;for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook.
This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell.
You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.
If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook.
Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal.
For this reason, many {@class}s keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.

## The Book's Appearance
Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes.
It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.
