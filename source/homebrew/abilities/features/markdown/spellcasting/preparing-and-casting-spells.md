# Preparing and Casting Spells
The {@class} table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your {@class} spells of 1st level and higher.
To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher.
You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of {@class} spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the {@class} spell list.
When you do so, choose a number of {@class} spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your {@class} level (minimum of one spell).
The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a {@certain-level} {@class}, you have {@amount-of-spell-slots}.
With a {@ability} of 16, your list of prepared spells can include {@amount-of-spells} spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination.
If you prepare the 1st-level spell {@example-spell}, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot.
Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.
Preparing a new list of {@class} spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
