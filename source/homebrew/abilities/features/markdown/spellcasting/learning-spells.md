# Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the {@class} spell list.

You learn an additional {@class} spell of your choice at each level except {@exception-levels}.
Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
For instance, when you reach {@this-level} in this class, you can learn one new spell of {@slot-levels}.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the {@class} spells you know and replace it with another spell from the {@class} spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

# Spell Versatility
Whenever you finish a long rest, you can replace one spell you learned from this spellcasting feature with another spell from the {@class} spell list.
The new spell must be the same level as the spell you replace.
