# Learning Spells
You have an array of spells that you are familiar with.
You may not be able to produce all of these spells at a moment's notice, but given some time to prepare, you can cast any of them.

## Spells Known
You know one spell of your choice from the {@class} spell list when you first obtain this spellcating feature.

> ## Variant: Starting with More Spells
> If you start your character at a higher level than level one, your DM might let you start with knowing more spells.
> A reasonable number of spells for the DM to start you with is the number of spells that you are able to prepare.

## Learning a New Spell
As a {@class}, you have the capacity to learn new spells, choosing from [the {@class} spell list].

Learning a new {@class} spell involves {@learning-spells}.
The process takes at least 3 hours and costs at least 300 silver pieces.
For each level of the spell, it takes an additional 3 hours and costs an additional 300 silver pieces.
The cost represents {@cost-learning}.
Once you have spent this time and money, you know the spell and can prepare it.
You must then finish a long rest before you can begin to learn another spell.

## Limit of Spells Known
The maximum number of {@class} spells that you may know is shown in the spells known column of the {@class} table for each level.
You may know fewer, but the number of {@class} spells that you know cannot surpass this number.

## Forgetting a Spell
Whenever you finish a long rest, you have the option to forget one spell of your choice.
You can also choose to forget a spell whenever you learn a new one, effectively replacing it.
