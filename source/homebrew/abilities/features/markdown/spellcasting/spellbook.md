# Spellbook
Your spellbook is an extended repository of the {@class} spells you know.
While your mind can only keep track of so many spells at a time, your spellbook can contain neigh infinite information.

## Copying a Spell into the Book
Whenever you learn a new {@class} spell, you can immediately add it to your spellbook (no additional action required).
Otherwise, you must spend the time and money necessary to author a new entry into your spellbook.

Adding a {@class} spell that you know to your spellbook involves transcribing its description and casting instructions, and illustrating its arcane designs and sigils&mdash;using a notation that is unique to you.
The process takes at least 30 minutes and costs at least 50 silver pieces.
For each level of the spell, it takes an additional 30 minutes and costs an additional 50 silver pieces.
The cost represents {@costly materials}.
You will have properly catalogued the spell into your spellbook once you have spent this time and money.

If you lose your spellbook, you can use this same procedure to transcribe the spells that you know into a new spellbook.
Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal.
Because of this, you might wish to produce multiple volumes of your spellbook to keep their contents safe, whether they contain duplicate copies of your spells or unique ones.

## Reviewing Spells from the Book
While you have access to the contents of your spellbook, you can spend time reviewing the spells that it contains to relearn them.
Reviewing a {@class} spell requires time spent perusing its respective entry: at least 5 minutes, plus an additional 5 minutes per level of the spell.
You must repeat this process for each spell that you wish to review.
Once you have spent this time studying, you know the spell(s) and can prepare them as normal.

You can study and relearn multiple spells per long rest in this way.

## Erasing Spells
If you want to erase a spell, you can tear the pages for a spell's entry out of your spellbook and destroy them.

## The Book's Appearance
Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes.
It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.
