# Spellcasting Ability
{@spellcasting-ability} is your spellcasting ability for your {@class} spells.
Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration.
You use your {@spellcasting-ability} whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.
In addition, you use your {@spellcasting-ability} modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a {@class} spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
- **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your {@spellcasting-ability} modifier
- **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your {@spellcasting-ability} modifier
