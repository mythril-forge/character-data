# Your Spellbook
The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse.
You might find other spells during your adventures.
You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil {@class}'s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.

A spellbook doesn't contain cantrips.

## Copying a Spell into the Book
When you find a {@class} spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.
Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the {@class} who wrote it.
You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.

For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp.
The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it.
Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.

A {@class} spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied.
When you copy a spell from a spell scroll, you must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level.
If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied.
Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.
