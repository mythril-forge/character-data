Deciphering and learning a written {@class} spell involves decoding the unique system of notation used by the mage who wrote it, then reproducing the basic form of the spell.
The process takes at least 30 minutes and costs at least 50 silver pieces.
For each level of the spell, it takes an additional 30 minutes and costs an additional 50 silver pieces.
