# Called Shots
Starting at {@level}, you learn to spot and exploit weaknesses in an opponent's fighting form&mdash;hitting them where it hurts most.
When you make an attack, you can declare a number between 1 and your fighter level to take as a penalty to hit.
If your attack hits, it deals extra damage equal to your declared penalty.

You can only use this feature before you make your Attack Roll.
