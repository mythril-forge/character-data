# Thieves' Cant
During your rogue training you learned thieves' cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation.
Only another creature that can understand the language you are speaking and knows thieves' cant recognizes such messages.
It takes four times longer to convey messages with thieves' cant than it does to speak the same idea plainly.

In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.
These symbols vary for different langauges, so you can only read and write these symbols in languages that you know.
