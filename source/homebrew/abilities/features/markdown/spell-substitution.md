# Spell Substitution
You don't accept the fact that once spells are prepared, they can't be exchanged for other spells without undertaking a bothersome spellcasting cooldown period.
Indeed, you have come to the conclusion that this cooldown period is emphatically *not* necessary.
You can know a number of extra {@class} spells at a time equal to your {@class} level.
You also can prepare your list of {@class} spells whenever you finish a short or long rest, choosing from the spells that you know as normal.
Completing a long rest is still necessary to properly review the spells in your spellbook or learn new ones.
