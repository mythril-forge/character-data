# Feral Instinct
By {@level}, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls if you aren't wearing heavy armor.

Additionally, if you are surprised on your turn and aren't incapacitated, you can act normally&mdash;but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.
