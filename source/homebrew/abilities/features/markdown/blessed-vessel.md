# Blessed Vessel
By {@level}, your body has become a conduit for raw divine energy.
You gain resistance to radiant damage.

Once you die, your dead body is protected from decay and can't become undead; this indefinately extends any time limits placed on being raised from the dead.
If you died from old age, you can be ressurected and live for one more year before dying again from old age.
If you ever are brought back to life, you retain memories of your afterlife.

If your dead body remains in the same place for one full week, its location becomes consecrated, as if the *hallow* spell was cast there.
The effect dissipates if your body is removed from its resting place for one full week.
