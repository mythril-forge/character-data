# Spell Mastery
At {@level}, you have achieved such mastery over your low-level spells that you can cast them at will.

By spending the duration of a short rest in study, you can memorize up to one {@class} spell that is in your spellbook.
Once you have a spell memorized, it counts as a cantrip for you, and it doesn't count against the maximum number of spells you can know or prepare.
You can only memorize 1st-level spells in this way.

You can exchange a spell that you have memorized in this way for another by spending the duration of an additional short rest in study.

Once you reach {@level}, you can memorize up to two {@class} spells that are in your spellbook.
One of these spells can be of 2nd-level.
