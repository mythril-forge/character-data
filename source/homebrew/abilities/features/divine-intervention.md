# Divine Intervention
Beginning at `{( level )}`, you can call upon the greater powers of your faith to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.

Imploring for such a miracle requires you to take an action.
Describe the assistance you seek, and make a special divinity check using a one hundred twenty-sided die.
Add your wisdom ability score and `{( class )}` level when making this check.
If the result is greater than one hundred twenty, the greater powers of your faith intervene.
The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any `{( class )}` spell would be appropriate.

You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.
If you trigger an intervention, you must also wait one full month before you can use this feature again.

By `{( level )}`, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.
- **Divinity Check** = 1d120 + your cleric level + your wisdom ability score
