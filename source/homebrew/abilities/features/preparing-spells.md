# Preparing Spells
You have a list of prepared spells&mdash;spells that are available for you to cast on a whim.
To prepare a spell is to intimately connect with it: you must accept the spell's presence and meaning into your mind, and allow your body to become a conduit for its magic.

## Preparing One or More Spells
You have the magical wherewithal to prepare a list of spells, choosing from the {@class} spells that you know.
You cannot prepare a spell if you do not know it.

Preparing a {@class} spell requires time spent {@preparing-spells}: at least 5 minutes, plus an additional 5 minutes per level of the spell.
You must repeat this process for each spell that you wish to prepare.
To finish preparing your spells, you need to complete a long rest.

## Limit of Spells Prepared
The *"Max. Spells Prepared"* column of the *"{@class}"* table shows the maximum number of {@class} spells that you can have prepared at a given level.
You can choose to have fewer, but the number of {@class} spells that you have prepared can never exceed this number.

## Removing Prepared Spells
You can choose to remove one or more {@class} spells that you have prepared whenever you finish a long rest.
Likewise, you can choose to remove a spell whenever you prepare a new one, effectively replacing it.
If a prepared spell that you know is forgotten, it ceases to be prepared.

Casting a spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.
