# Channel Divinity
At {@level}, you gain the ability to channel divine energy and use it to fuel magical effects.
You will have been granted a {@class} feature that details such an effect.
As you advance in {@class} levels, you may earn additional effects with which to use this power, as shown in the *"{@class}"* table.

When you use a *Channel Divinity* effect that requires a saving throw, set its difficulty class equal to your spell save difficulty class.

Once you use your *Channel Divinity*, you must finish a short or long rest to use it again.
Beginning at {@level}, you can use your *Channel Divinity* twice between rests.
By {@level}, you can use it three times between rests.
When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.
