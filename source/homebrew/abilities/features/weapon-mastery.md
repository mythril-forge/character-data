# Weapon Mastery
By {@level}, you have honed your attacks to near perfection through hard work and dedication.
Whenever you make an attack roll that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can take a reaction to add a plus 1d10 bonus to your roll if you rolled 10 or less on your core die.
You must decide whether to use this feature before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses.
