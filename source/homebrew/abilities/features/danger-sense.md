# Danger Sense
At {@level}, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.
You have advantage on dexterity saving throws against effects that you can sense, such as traps and spells.
To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated, and you can't be wearing heavy armor.
