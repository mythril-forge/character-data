# Spellcasting Ability
`{( spellcasting-ability )}` is your spellcasting ability for your `{( class )}` spells.
`{( source-of-magic )}`.
You use your `{( spellcasting-ability )}` whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.
In addition, you use your `{( spellcasting-ability )}` modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a `{( class )}` spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
- **Spell Save DC** = 9 + your proficiency bonus + your `{( spellcasting-ability )}` modifier
- **Spell Attack Modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your `{( spellcasting-ability )}` modifier
