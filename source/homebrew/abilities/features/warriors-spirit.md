# Warrior's Spirit
At {@level}, you have embraced gritty determination.
Your fighting spirit can delay the very clutches of death.
When you start dying, you can choose to retain your consciousness and act as normal&mdash;even as you draw your last breath.
You must continue to make death saving throws at the beginning of your turn, however, and taking damage causes death saving throw failures as normal.
Three failed death saving throws can still kill you.

While you are dying, you can choose to fall unconscious at any moment (no action required).
