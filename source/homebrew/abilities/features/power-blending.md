# Power Blending
You theorize that spell slots are a shorthand for an underlying energy that powers all spellcasting, and you've found a way to tinker with the hierarchy of spell slots.
When you finish a short rest, you can use your *Arcane Recovery* feature to replenish arcana points by consuming your spell slots.
For each spell slot that you expend, you gain a number of arcana points equal to the slot level's conversion rate minus one, as shown on the "*Conversion Rates*" table in that feature.
