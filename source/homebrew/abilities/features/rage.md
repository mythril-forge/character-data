# Rage
In battle, you fight with primal ferocity.
You can enter a rage by taking a bonus action.

If you aren't wearing heavy armor, you gain the following benefits while you rage:
- You have advantage on strength ability checks.
- You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
- When you hit with an attack using strength, you deal an amount of extra damage that increases when you gain {@class} levels, as shown in the *"Rage Damage"* column of the *"{@class}"* table.

If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them while raging.
Raging doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell&mdash;such as heat metal&mdash;that you've already cast.
You have disadvantage on constitution saving throws that you make to maintain your concentration on spells while you are raging.

Your rage lasts for 5 minutes and ends early if you are knocked unconscious.
It also ends at the start of your turn if you didn't attack a hostile creature since beginning your previous turn, or take or deal damage since then.
Otherwise, you can take a bonus action to end your rage.

Once you have raged the number of times shown for your {@class} level in the *"Rages"* column of the *"{@class}"* table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.
