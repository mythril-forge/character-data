# Ritual Practitioner
By {@level}, you have studied the arts of magic extensively, and have become adept at following spell recipes without having to memorize them.
With your spellbook in hand, you can cast a {@class} spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have it in your spellbook.
You don't need to know the spell or have it prepared.
