# Second Wind
Beginning at `{( level )}`, you have a limited well of stamina that you can draw upon to protect yourself from harm.
You can take a bonus action to regain a number of hit points that increases when you gain `{( class )}` levels, as shown in the *"Second Wind"* column of the *"`{( class )}`"* table.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.
Starting at `{( level )}`, you can use it twice before resting.
