# Spell Mastery
At `{( level )}`, you have achieved such mastery over your spells that you can make one your signature spell.

A signature spell counts as a cantrip but retains its casting level.
When upcast, its casting level increases by the expended spell slot's level.
You always know your signature spell, and it still counts against your number of spells known.

You can master one wizard spell that you know by spending 30 hours in study and using 60 component kits, punctuated by finishing a long rest.
It becomes your signature spell when you complete this process.

You can have up to one signature spell, and it must be of 1st level.
By level `{( level )}`, you have achieved further mastery over your magic such that you can have a second signature spell of 2nd level.
Finally, when you become a level `{( level )}` `{( class )}`, you can have a third signature spell of 3rd level.

> ## Variant: Low-Magic Mastery
> You can use this variant rule to have enhanced lower-level signature spells.
> Whenever the *Spell Mastery* feature says that you can master a spell of a certain level, you can choose one of that level or lower.
> A lower-leveled signature spell has a casting level of its maximum allowed level, meaning it is upcast to that level.
>
> For example, rather than mastering a 1st-level spell&mdash;like Burning Hands&mdash;you could choose a cantrip that can be upcast to 1st level&mdash;like Firebolt.
